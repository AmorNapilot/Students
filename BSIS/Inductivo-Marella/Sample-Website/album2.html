		<h3><span>The bond that links <br>your true family is not one of blood,<br> but of respect and <br>joy in each other's life.
</span></h3>
		<div class="photo-album">
			<h1><span>My love my Family</span></h1>
			<a href="#" class="large album_effect img1"><img src="images/album/family1.jpg" alt="">Family is not an important thing. It's everything.</a>
			<a href="#" class="album_effect img2"><img src="images/album/family2.jpg" alt="">All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="small album_effect img3"><img src="images/album/family3.jpg" alt="">To us, family means putting your arms around each other and being there.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="medium album_effect img4"><img src="images/album/family4.jpg" alt="">Family means no one gets left behind or forgotten.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="album_effect img5"><img src="images/album/family5.jpg" alt="">I think togetherness is a very important ingredient to family life.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="album_effect img6"><img src="images/album/family6.jpg" alt="">“No man has ever lived that had enough of children’s gratitude or woman’s love.”

</a>
			<a href="#" class="album_effect img7"><img src="images/album/family7.jpg" alt="">Sister is probably the most competitive relationship within the family, but once the sisters are grown, it becomes the strongest relationship.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="small album_effect img8"><img src="images/album/family8.jpg" alt="">“Rejoice with your family in the beautiful land of life!”

</a>
			<a href="#" class="medium album_effect img9"><img src="images/album/family9.jpg" alt="">A happy family is but an earlier heaven.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="album_effect img10"><img src="images/album/family10.jpg" alt="">In every conceivable manner, the family is link to our past, bridge to our future.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="small album_effect img11"><img src="images/album/family11.jpg" alt="">I've always put my family first and that's just the way it is.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="small album_effect img12"><img src="images/album/family12.jpg" alt="">One of the things that binds us as a family is a shared sense of humor.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="small album_effect img13"><img src="images/album/family13.jpg" alt="">A father is a man who expects his son to be as good a man as he meant to be.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="small album_effect img14"><img src="images/album/family14.jpg" alt="">It was my father who taught me to value myself. He told me that I was uncommonly beautiful and that I was the most precious thing in his life.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="album_effect img15"><img src="images/album/family15.jpg" alt="">It is easier for a father to have children than for children to have a real father.
</a>
			<a href="#" class="album_effect img16"><img src="images/album/family16.jpg" alt="">Love and fear. Everything the father of a family says must inspire one or the other.
