			“I wanted a perfect ending. Now I've learned, the hard way, that some poems don't rhyme, and some stories don't have a clear beginning, middle, and end. Life is about not knowing, having to change, taking the moment and making the best of it, without knowing what's going to happen next.
Delicious Ambiguity.”

Choose your thoughts carefully. Keep what brings you peace and let go of what doesn’t. Happiness is only one thought away.

<br>
<br>


Sometimes you just need to relax and trust that things will work out. Let go a little and let life happen.

<br>
<br>


Communicate. Even when it’s uncomfortable or uneasy. One of the best ways to heal, is simply getting everything out.
<br>
<br>

life day by day and be grateful for the little things. Don’t get caught up in what you can’t control. Focus on the positive.
