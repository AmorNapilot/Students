				<div class="content-border"><p>You may have a steel or a sharpener at home, but once a year, get a pro to revive those knives. Your chopping will get faster, more precise-and, believe it or not, safer.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>Chicken breasts are expensive and can get dull after a while; thighs are juicier, cheaper, and more flavorful.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>There's nothing worse than limp herbs. Next time, trim the stems and put the parsley in a glass of water, fit a plastic bag over it, and stash it in the refrigerator.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>Having cooked grains in your fridge means that fried rice, pilafs, rice bowls and robust salads are just minutes away.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>A freezer full of roasted turkey necks and bony beef cuts will ensure you always have what you need to make broth.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>You cannot toss a salad or mix cookies or make meatballs in a tiny cereal bowl. All you can do is make a bigger mess.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>A quick stint in a dry skillet over medium heat wakes dry spices up and releases their oils, which means your paprika will taste a lot more paprika-y. Use whole spices, watch the pan like a hawk, and stir constantly until the spices are fragrant, then transfer to a plate to cool before using.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>Especially when cooking meat. Smoke equals char, and char is delicious.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>It adds texture. It makes the dressing pop. It’s proof that there’s nothing—nothing—you shouldn’t be salting.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>If you don’t, the temperature in the refrigerator will rise. And the only thing that benefits is mold.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>Warm some butter or olive oil over medium-high heat. Lay in bread and fry until golden on both sides. Sell your toaster.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>They’ll keep longer that way, so you’ll always be able to add fresh lemon juice to everything from dressings to cocktails. Plus, you can use the squeezed rinds to clean and deodorize your wooden cutting boards.</p></div><br>
				<div class="content-border"><p>It heats more evenly than tin, and when your pie is perfectly golden-brown everywhere, you’ll know it.</p></div><br>
