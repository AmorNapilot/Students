        In Proverbs 8:2-31, it says, "The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth: While as yet he had not made the earth, nor te fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: When he set a compass upon the face of the depth: When he established the clouds aboe: When he strengthened the fountains of the deep: When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: When he appointed the foundations of the earth: Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him; Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men."

    <h2>Wisdom VS Knowledge</h2>
    <br>
        <p>
            Knowledge and understanding the mysteries in the Bible are not attainable by human efforts; but they are given by God. The Bible is a sealed book and can only be understood by Divine Intervention. As said in the book of Luke 24:45, "Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures..." But what kind of people are those who will not in any manner, understand the Scriptures? The Bible calls them wicked. In Daniel 12:9-10 it says, "And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end. Many sall be purified, and made white, and tried. but the wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall understand: but the wise shall understand/
