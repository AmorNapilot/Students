            <h1>Maine Coons </h1><br/><br/>
            <p>Maine Coons can rival the size of small dogs and are highly intelligent, playful and energetic. They thrive in families that include children and other pets, including dogs. Be aware that they are very dexterous and are capable of using their front paws like raccoons to scoop up food. They like to dunk favorite toys in water bowls. They have been known to stretch up, wrap their front paws on door knobs and open doors </a> <br />

            <h1>Exotic Short-Hair</h1><br/>
            <p>My fave breed is the Exotic Shorthair. I have two of these flat-faced sweethearts. While they are high maintenance (daily brushing and eye cleaning are required) and costly to own, they are worth it! Exotics tend to be even tempered, easygoing, and affectionate. They generally don't like to be left alone and can become very attached to their owners. My two follow me around from room to room and although they aren't lap cats, they are always close by. My oldest one doesn't let me shower or use the bathroom alone! My favorite things about my Exotics are their sweet loving purrsonalities, thick soft coats, large round eyes, fluffy tails and stubby little legs. They make really great companions and are entertaining to watch. I don't see myself ever owning another breed of cat!.</a>

            <h1>Abyssinian </h1><br/><br/>
            <p>Abyssinians definitely put the "a" in active. These are go, go, go cats fueled by curiosity and motivated by studying and mimicking the actions of their favorite people. For these reasons, it is vital to install childproof latches on cabinets and other areas you don’t want your snoop-minded Abyssinian to seek out..</a> <br />
