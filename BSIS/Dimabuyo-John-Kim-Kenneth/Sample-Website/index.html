		<b>Don't Starve Together </b>
		<p>Don't Starve Together is the standalone multiplayer expansion of the uncompromising wilderness survival game, Don't Starve. Now including Reign of Giants; adding new characters, seasons, creatures, biomes, and Giant new challenges to Dont Starve Together.</p>

		<p>Enter a strange and unexplored world full of strange creatures, dangers, and surprises. Gather resources to craft items and structures that match your survival style. Play your way as you unravel the mysteries of this strange land. </p>

		<p>Cooperate with your friends in a private game, or take your chances with strangers online. Work with other players to survive the harsh environment, or strike out on your own. </p>

		<p>Do whatever it takes, but most importantly, Don't Starve.</p>

		<h2 class="h2tag">Features</h2>
		<p>Don't Starve Together has multiple ways to play with others: local, network, and matchmaking play. Many items have been balanced or removed in order to keep the game fair. Game mode and PvP are optional by the server operator. Dedicated, player-hosted and LAN servers are available, and chat is global or local depending on the server admin's preference. A type of server called "Friends Only" allows a server to be created whereby the only people who can join have to be on your steam friends list. Many console commands have changed or been removed for DST.</p><!-What is DST-!>

		<h2>Game Modes</h2>
		<p>There are three game modes, with additional modes supported by mods. <b>Survival</b> is the default mode, intended to be a cooperative, more difficult mode, in which dead players become ghosts that drain the sanity of living players by 3.3/min (up to 10/min total). When all players are dead in Survival, a timer starts and if no players are revived in that time, the world is reset. Endless mode is intended to be a more relaxed mode that doesn't force players to cooperate. In <b>Endless</b>, the world never resets and players may resurrect themselves at the spawn portal. <b>Wilderness</b> is intended to be more like other survival games. Players spawn in random locations across the map, there are no ghosts and players who die are returned to character select screen, wiping their map and re-spawning them in a new random location. No resurrection items exist, including touchstones (although their set pieces with pig heads will still be generated).</p>

		<h2>Ghosts</h2>
		<p>Ghost Players are a new feature that introduces the ability to live after death, although in a downgraded state. Whenever a player dies a skeleton spawns where they have died, dropping their inventory, and become a ghost. Upon death, WX-78 also loses its upgrades and drops an amount of Gears.</p>
		<p>Ghosts can Haunt items and structures, possibly setting the object on fire, or affecting it in some other way. A ghost can be resurrected using a Touch Stone, Meat Effigy, Life Giving Amulet, Telltale Heart or Florid Postern Portal. Players may only resurrect through the Florid Postern Portal if the server is set to Endless Mode. When the ghost re-spawns, their inventory will be empty and their hunger and sanity are set to the same as resurrection in the base game. Re-spawning with the Telltale Heart or with the Florid Postern Portal will apply a 12.5% or 25% maximum health penalty, respectively, on the player, which caps at 75% maximum health points (leaving the player with 25%). The health lost to this penalty can be restored by 25% using a Booster Shot. In Survival Mode, other players will suffer a continuous 3.3/min sanity drain for each ghost (up to 10/min total).</p>

		<h2>Rebalancing</h2>
		<p>Don't Starve Together has Caves and Ruins, which must be toggled on before starting a game. Due to a server being required for each map, the Ruins are a part of the Caves levels instead of being a stand-alone map. Reign of Giants content is also a part of the current build. Shipwrecked has not been implemented, but some mods make a portion of the content available.</p>

		<p>Thermal stones now have durability, intended to resemble cracks formed as a result of heating and cooling. Armor has less durability (by 30%) and can no longer be multiplicatively stacked as before; the game now uses the better armor's absorption and then divides the damage absorbed between the two worn armors weighted by their absorption. The Pan Flute now has the ability to knock other players besides the user unconscious for a short time, as long as PVP is enabled.</p>

		<p>Due to gears being a less available resource, WX-78 now starts with 150 health, sanity, and hunger, but each set of gears provide less of an upgrade (still bringing him to 300/400/200 overall after 15 upgrades).</p>

		<p>Willow has a large part of her advantages (and a few disadvantages) removed. These changes were mainly added due to the abuse of Willow burning things or attacking players in their first day. Willow's fire damage reduction is now only 50%, instead of 100%. Her lighter now lasts 1.25 days, but can be crafted. Willow no longer creates fires at low sanity and has a 10% boost on sanity gained from fire. However, this entire modification has created a generally negative response from the community. On June 3, 2015, Willow received more changes. She now gets colder when insane, is completely immune to fire for the first three seconds of exposure, can cook with her lighter (reducing its durability by 1%), can craft her lighter with fewer materials and starts the game with Bernie, the stuffed bear seen in her portrait.</p>

		<p>Woodie's Wood meter is now present at all times, which serves to warn players of the Werebeaver; once the Wood meter reaches 25 the transformation occurs. Woodie can eat Grass, Twigs, and Logs to replenish the Wood meter. The Werebeaver loses many of its benefits, discouraging it's usability for griefing and PvP. The Werebeaver now shares Woodie's Health and Sanity meters as well as having the Wood meter replace the Hunger meter. Letting the Wood meter reach zero induces the same health drain as letting the Hunger meter reach zero. Death in the Werebeaver form is true death; Woodie becomes a beaver-looking ghost but still cannot use the map, making it harder to revive oneself. His sanity drains incredibly quickly, about 3/second, making it incredibly less beneficial to stay transformed. To turn back into Woodie the player must get the Wood meter back to 100. However, the Werebeaver can no longer eat Pine Cones, Grass Tufts, Saplings, or the like. To make up for the changes, Woodie gains Sanity from planting trees and Lucy the Axe cannot be used or even picked up by other players. During a Full Moon, Woodie instantly transforms into the Werebeaver, in likeness to normal Don't Starve. However, during the Full Moon, the Wood meter decreases rapidly, even after the player has managed to fill the meter and exit Werebeaver state, making it rather difficult, but possible, to obtain Glommer's Flower (The rate of which the wood meter depletes is undetermined).</p>

		<p>Maxwell now comes only with his Codex Umbra and 6 Nightmare Fuel. His Sanity boost has been reduced from 20/min to 6.67/min. The Shadow Tab was added, in which one can craft the Codex and different types of puppets. Puppets cost 2 Nightmare Fuel, a tool matching their action, and 20% (worker) or 35% (duelist) of Maxwell's maximum sanity.</p>

		<p>Many of the enemies whose only purpose is to be fought have had their health increased:</p>	

		<h2>New Entities</h2>
		<p>Meteors now fall near rocky biomes, in periodic showers. These make rocks renewable on the surface, and sometimes also provide moon rocks, which can be used for moon rock walls. The Ewecus has also been added as an alternative to the Varg, found at the end of animal tracks (the probability of finding a koalefant is the same, but the remaining probability is split between the Varg and Ewecus). Water Balloons can be crafted as a firefighting tool. Whirly Fans can be crafted to help survive summer with less preparation, and there is a new weapon, Tail o' Three Cats.</p>

		<h2>Sleeping</h2>
		<p>Sleeping has been significantly changed. Normally, when going to sleep, the day would fast-forward to sunrise and replenish health and sanity at the cost of hunger upon waking up. However, when on a server, sleeping will not fast forward to sunrise but will instead leave the player unable to move and unaffected by the night monster. This will replenish health and sanity while draining hunger faster than normal over time; the rate at which will be dependent on what type of structure or item was used to sleep. When using a normal sleeping item, the player can wake themselves up by trying to move. If the player was put to sleep (pan flute, cooking a mandrake, etc.), they will reawaken after a small amount of time. The player will always wake up if hunger reaches 0.</p>

		<h2>Reputation</h2>
		<p>Attacking players, giving players items and reviving ghosts is tracked by the game and can impact what other characters say about said player when inspecting them. For example, if Willow were to inspect a harmless Wilson she would say "Hi (playername)!", but had he been attacking someone, she would say, "Why, (playername)... that fire in your eyes!" or if a player has been reviving other players, she will say "(playername) won't leave anyone behind.</p>

		<h2>Through the Ages</h2>
		<p>Wilson riding a Beefalo in Through the Ages teaser.
		A new, free DLC called Through the Ages was announced for the Spring of 2015, and would contain new content specifically made for multiplayer, such as mounting Beefalo using saddles.[2] However, due to complications with implementing Cave biomes, Klei has pushed back the DLC with no release date at this time. Some of these features were incorporated into the game by the update of December 23, 2015.</p>

		<h2>Resource Swaps</h2>
		<p>Berry Bushes, Grass Tufts, and Saplings now each have an alternate form (Juicy Berry Bushes, Grass Gekkos, and Twiggy Trees, respectively). At any given time, the world is in a season for one or the other of these versions, and the other one will become Diseased and die off. Additionally, sometimes an area will have all of its trees converted to stone trees that drop flint, stone, and nitre when mined.</p>

		<h2>Beefalo Domestication</h2>
		<p>Beefalo can now be domesticated. While in the process of domestication, they can be ridden by using a Saddle. The Saddlehorn aids in keeping saddles undamaged, and the Brush helps with the domestication process. See Beefalo - Don't Starve Together for more information.</p>
