		<p>There are currently fifteen playable Characters in Don't Starve (including DLC characters). The first accessible character is Wilson, considered the protagonist and the focus of the game's story. Each character has different perks and cons, and usually are different in play style. Most of the other Characters can be unlocked when sufficient Experience has been accrued, gained at Death or when escaping to a new world.</p>

		<p>There are currently five exception characters that are not gained by conventional experience, but through game feats.</p>

		<p>If the player has not unlocked a Character, it will appear as their respective silhouettes. Upon selecting a silhouette, the Poster on the left will be a coffin shut with chains and a lock, and the description will simply say "The Unknown".</p>

		<p>Each character is "voiced" by a different instrument (except Wes, the speechless mime) and speaks differently when examining items and objects (Wes pantomimes instead). In addition, each character has at least one unique perk or ability.</p>

		<p>Below are the abilities and requirements to unlock each character. (DLC characters have an icon by their name.)</p>
