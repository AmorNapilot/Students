		<hr>

		<p> I've made this website of mine to serve as my 'Quiz' in Web Application Development under our professor Mr. Valente. I've decided that it would be a personal website cause I want it to be unique. I want the viewer to know me just by visiting my website. All though there are things that I wanted to do but I wasn't able to do because of the lack of experience I have and knowledge to do it, I managed to put everything in it. I've made it more pleasing to the eye of the viewer and chose the classy combination of the colors gray white and black. The contents are readable so an average person could read them easily.  </p>
		<p> Overall, I guess I could say that we enjoyed making this 'quiz' not only because we can put our different tastes of art in it but we also massively learned a lot. We learned how to make websites! It's kinda awesome because not everyone can make their own websites. It's kinda weird to realize that it's so much fun making one, after all the headaches and frustrations we had. I hope this we will learn more from Mr. Valente.  </p>
