<h3>Enterprise Architecture and e-Government Projects</h3>
<p>Enterprise Architecture and e-Government Projects
In Punjab, Pakistan
E-Government here is in its infant stage, meaning it is not yet fully implemented in the entire government and improvements are still going strong. The Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB) which handles ICT projects of the provincial government divides their e-projects into three sectors: Infrastructure, E-Monitoring and E-Services of which multiple sub-project officials were interviewed in order to gather information as precisely as possible.<br>
It can be considered that PITB is the center of all E-projects of the entire province. Any department of the government that requires their aid must route to a provincial secretariat which then forwards their request to them. The relevant project team then coordinates with said department of the government in order to formulate and design to suite the required specifications of the department. The PITB’s infrastructure is adequate enough for the job but in times that it isn’t available, third party infrastructures are called and used. The e-projects developed can be sorted into three divisions: service, sector and infrastructure.<br>
Service - This divisions type of projects can be divided in to two sub-categories<br> 	
Citizen Service Projects- tend to refer to departments that tend to handle or make contact with citizens directly so they can use their facilities efficiently and effectively.  (Manual)
	(Examples: Punjab Health Line, Citizen Contact Center etc.)
<br>
Back office Application- includes Information Management System, which is used by different government organizations that does not involve direct citizen interactions. (Automated) 
 	(Examples: Dengue Activity Tracking System, Traffic Monitoring etc.)
<br>
Sector- This division divides the project to smaller groups that focuses on a single objective or priority.
(Examples: Agriculture, Health, Fishery, Education, Law and Order etc.)
<br>
Infrastructure – As stated earlier PITB handles the infrastructure resources and answers the needs of most government agencies as well as other third party members. The vision is to build an efficient, reliable, secure and cost effective ICT infrastructure and services center that is entrusted by the government as well as by the private sector.
<br>
Conclusion:
	The paper concludes that the PITB do follow a given framework defined from within the Organization, but the studies also show that there is a need to review, device and follow a standard Enterprise Architecture guideline that can standardize the business, information, services, applications as well as infrastructures of future e-projects for better stability.
 	It is also noted that the Zachman framework can help in drafting a standard enterprise level e-government architectural framework to guide the decision makers, planners, designers, developers, and implementers to be on the same page. This will also ensure that the existing standards can evolve to a better framework as science and technology improves with as little change possible.
