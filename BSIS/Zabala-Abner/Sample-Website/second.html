<h3>E-Government Enterprise Architecture Research in China: A Critical Assessment</h3>
<p>"This paper attempts to systematically analyze China's e-government EA research in a systematic way, as progress on research could guide the real-world practice."<br>
As stated above this paper focuses on seeking and organizing papers dedicated to the practices of EA, They have categorized their choices into two: Core and non-Core journals. Core journals are said to come from China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) which approximately holds 99% of all journals, and None-Core journals from the China 'E-government Journal' which has high ratings and influence in the field. In total they had gathered 41 journals that are affiliated with Enterprise Architecture, which they then processed by means of a multifaceted coding method.
The journals are then analyzed through each “facets”<br>
<strong>Author institution affiliation</strong>- to know which institutions are the major players in the research area, and from which sector of the society<br>

<strong>Author's disciplinary department </strong>in universities or research institutions
Given the interdisciplinary nature of e-government research, this indicator intends
to explore to which disciplinary department the scholars belong.<br>

<strong>Publish journal</strong>- this indicator could suggest publish venues of EA papers, and determine which journals publish more studies in this area;<br>

<strong>Journal issue</strong>- to examine publications in the field over time and to explore the research tendency.<br>

<strong>Paper length in term of page number</strong>- to take paper length as one of indicators of paper quality<br>

<strong>Research theme</strong>- to classify the research themes by its subjects in order to explore the major focus of current studies in this area;<br>

<strong>Research methods</strong>- we classify the research methods into theoretical, empirical, and descriptive in order to summarize the major methods adopted in existing researches;<br>

<strong>Level of Analysis</strong>- to classify the governmental levels of analysis of current studies.<br>

<strong>Geographical Focus</strong>- to categorize the geographic focus of current studies into domestic, foreign and comparative studies.<br>
