<h3>Descendants of the sun</h3>
<p>

A soldier and a doctor believe they've found true love in each other, until they realize the difference in their jobs may cause a rift too big to close. It's love at first sight for special forces Captain Yoo Shi Jin (Song Joong Ki) when he meets a beautiful doctor (Song Hye Kyo) who treats his wounds. Over before it can truly begin, the two separate due to their opposite values -- one being a soldier who takes lives, and the other a doctor who fights to save them. Almost a year later, a fateful reunion takes place in Uruk, causing them to work together. Can Shi Jin and Mo Yeon overcome their biggest hurdle, or was it never meant to be?</p>
