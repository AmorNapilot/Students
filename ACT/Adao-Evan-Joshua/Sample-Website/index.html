					<p><strong>Hey There!</strong> </p>
					<p>My name is Joshua Adao. I am from Laguna, Philippines and a student in La Verdad Christian College. The reason I mad this kind of site just because I love reading comics and watching movies specially if it's all about superheroes. The first ever superhero I have known is Superman, and afterwards I start loving different kinds if superheroes. The very first movie I enjoyed is the Teen Titans, Justice League and X Men. I'm very interested knowing all of the super powers of each. From now on almost all of the Marvel and DC's superheroes are pretty cool some them are having a solo movies in cinemas which I really enjoy watching.</p>

					<p>I just made a simple site in which I include my most favorite superheroes in each.   </p>
					<p>So yeah I just include some of my favorites. In Marvel you noticed almost all of them are part of the Avengers. But yeah This Marvel's 2016 "<strong>Civil War</strong>" Spiderman is part of the movie which is awesome!!. Marvel has made a very job well done in this film They already did what the crowd is waiting. In DC I also just include some Part if the Justice League. You know what I'm just wondering if is it possible that Marvel and DC would combine and make a movie about superheroes? I hope that would happen in the future. But yeah I think it is also impossible to happen.  </p>

			<h2>Which is better for me?</h2>
			<p>If you're gonna ask me which is better I would choose Marvel. Because they give everything to the people, in short it's complete. The chillz, thrill and etc which is really exciting. </p>
