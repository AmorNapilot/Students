		<p>I am Noella Amor M. Napilot. 18 years of age. Studying in La Verdad Christian College, 2nd year student and has a program of Associate in Computer Technology. I don't know why I got this program because at first I only used MSWord and browser when it comes to computer but I started loving it anyway especially typography tho I'm not yet good at it. I live at Blk 17, Lt-16 Ph. 3 Peace Village Brgy. San Luis Antipolo City, Rizal but I am staying at 8th Avenue, Larlin Village, Apalit, Pampanga. My mother is Thelma Napilot and she's a housewife and my father is Noel H. Napilot and he's a jeepney driver. I have two elder brothers J.c. and Jayson Napilot. I had graduated in Bagong Nayong II Elementary School and Antipolo National Highschool. </p>
		
		<p>I love math, the color of blue and the style of Avril Lavigne. But I love the most is to serve the Lord. I have friends but I always want to be alone. I love foods but I can't cook. I love reading books but I don't have passion in writing my own story. I don't have sports and I can't sing. For the shortest I am simple and boring, the only exciting part of my life is serving Lord, attending service and fellowship.</p>
